# credit-risk-classification


## Overview

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the use of logistic regression to predict loan risk. The code uses a dataset of loan data and performs the following tasks:

1. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. Creating a logistic regression model with the original data.
3. Resampling the training data to address class imbalance.
4. Creating a logistic regression model with the resampled data.

## Code Structure

- `loan_risk_prediction.py`: The main Python script that contains the code for data preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation.
- `Resources/lending_data.csv`: The dataset used for loan risk prediction.
- `Report.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Results

The code will generate classification reports and accuracy scores for both the original logistic regression model and the model trained with resampled data. These results help assess the model's performance in predicting loan risk.
